                  <p>Hosted by Zaid Haque from Microsoft. <br><br>Great! You've come up with an idea. What happens next? We'll work on seeing how you could go from an idea to a prototype, using Adobe's
                    free tool called XD. We'll also discuss how you could test this out on others, and what questions to
                    ask (and what not to ask!) when doing so. <br><br>
                    In interest of time, please download AdobeXD before the workshop!</p>

                  <p>Great! You've come up with an idea. What happens next? Some people might jump straight
                    into code or development. Before you do that, though, it might make sense to 'show' your
                    idea to others, rather than just tell them. We'll work on seeing how you could go from
                    an idea to a prototype, using Adobe's free tool called XD. We'll also discuss how you
                    could test this out on others, and what questions to ask (and what not to ask!) when
                    doing so.<br><br>
                    In interest of time, please download AdobeXD before the workshop!</p>

                  <p>Ubiquitous smartphones with a large number of sensors, such as optical, audio, and GPS are emerging as a fast, intelligent
                    and contextually aware computing platform. At the same time, powerful cloud computing and fast networks make large computing
                    resources available relatively inexpensive and accessible. Together, ubiquitous real world data and ubiquitous access to
                    inexpensive high-performance computing are propelling artificial intelligence to become foundational technologies for a
                    new generation of intelligent applications by teaching computers to learn, to recognize and understand real world data.
                    As AI advances and is more widely relied on, it is essential that we trust the output of these systems to be safe and fair.</p>

                    success – and the even bigger thrill of people BUYING your product – you need to tamp down
                    that ‘if you build it, they will come’ enthusiasm and do some intentional planning, research
                    and validation. In this talk, we’ll cover the essential blueprint you can follow to ensure

                  <p>Hi! My name is Austin Ward, I'm a software engineer by trade and a programmer at heart. I enjoy creating robust, production-ready code but also hacking things together when that's not required. My recent areas of interest include go-lang, open source, and dev ops tools. <br> <br>One thing University doesn't teach you is writing production grade code. This talk will go over how to do so using go-lang.</p>

                      entrepreneurs and founders start with an idea and move right to code. But if you want
                      success – and the even bigger thrill of people BUYING your product – you need to tamp down
                      that ‘if you build it, they will come’ enthusiasm and do some intentional planning, research
                      and validation. In this talk, we’ll cover the essential blueprint you can follow to ensure
                      your product’s success, all before writing any code.</p>

                      <br> <br>Too many young women are not confident in themselves whether that be in their skills, their bodies, or in themselves. Yet, a crucial key to leadership is confidence, confidence not only among female peers, but also among
                      male peers. In this workshop, I will discuss ways in which we, women, doubt ourselves, why it is detrimental to our success, and simple techniques as well as big concepts on how to improve our confidence and feel like the empowered
                      strong women we all are.</p>

                          <p>Hi! My name is Austin Ward, I'm a software engineer by trade and a programmer at heart. I enjoy creating robust, production-ready code but also hacking things together when that's not required. My recent areas of interest include go-lang, open source, and dev ops tools. <br> <br>One thing University doesn't teach you is writing production grade code. This talk will go over how to do so using go-lang.</p>

                          <p>Ubiquitous smartphones with a large number of sensors, such as optical, audio, and GPS are emerging as a fast, intelligent
                            and contextually aware computing platform. At the same time, powerful cloud computing and fast networks make large computing
                            resources available relatively inexpensive and accessible. Together, ubiquitous real world data and ubiquitous access to
                            inexpensive high-performance computing are propelling artificial intelligence to become foundational technologies for a
                            new generation of intelligent applications by teaching computers to learn, to recognize and understand real world data.
                            As AI advances and is more widely relied on, it is essential that we trust the output of these systems to be safe and fair.</p>
